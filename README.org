#+TITLE: options

* Overview

  A ~getopts~ implementation in pure fish. Modeled after [[https://github.com/fisherman/getopts][fisherman/getopts]], but
  with less (zero) ~awk~.

* Installation

  #+BEGIN_SRC fish
    fisher install colstrom/options.fish
  #+END_SRC

* Compatibility

  ~options~ is intended to be fully compatible with ~getopts~, though it include
  additional features (such as reading options from STDIN), where that does not
  affect compatibility.

  Any scenario where something works with ~getopts~ but not with ~options~
  should be considered a defect, and reported.

* License

  ~options~ is available under the [[https://tldrlegal.com/license/mit-license][MIT License]]. See ~LICENSE.txt~ for the full
  text.
